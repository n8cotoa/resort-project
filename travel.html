  <p>To keep our private island pristene from the outside world we do not have an airport. There are many other ways to get to Plaza del Epicodus. It's all part of the experience! The most common way for guests to get to the island is to fly into either India or Shri Lanka international airports. From there you will board a bajou hover craft to the coastline. After that you have many options of water craft transportation rentals.
